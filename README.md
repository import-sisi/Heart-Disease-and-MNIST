# Heart-Disease-and-MNIST
Heart Disease Survival Prediction:

The first project focuses on predicting the survival or death of heart patients using medical data. The project involves loading heart failure data, selecting random samples of living and deceased individuals, and analyzing the most important predictors of survival using forward selection techniques.
MNIST Dataset Classification:

The second project involves working with the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The tasks include loading the dataset, separating features and labels, and training a model (e.g., SVM) to classify the digits.
